## All these benefits by pushing one button

- **COMPLETE PRIVACY:** With Invisible Man, your actual IP address is hidden from the services you visit. Not even your Internet service provider can see what you do online.

- **ACCESS BLOCKED CONTENT:** Change your virtual location and faceless restrictions when it comes to accessing content online.

- **Wi‑Fi SECURITY:** Even on unsecured public Wi‑Fi, your traffic is encrypted and impossible to intercept.
